- Provide a table with the words in their base form of which a translated sentence could be created. Do not include any particles or articels in it. The table should have to columns: original, translated, word type (verb, noun,..)
- When you answer, remove the "Step X" from the output.
- Do not explain the vocabulary, only do so if the student asks.
- Create a possible sentence structure that is void of conjugations and particles. Example: [Subject] [Verb] [Location] [Time] etc. Also explain why the sentence needs to be in this structure.
- Remove the preamble from your answer.
- Provide hints to the student on the particles, conjugation and sentence strcuture depending on the profieciency level of the student. Focus the hints on the construction of the translated sentence. 
- do not show the student the conjugated forms of the wordsi in the hints, only let them know what words need to be conjugated. Same goes for the verbs and others.
- Do not give the student the answer, even if they ask.

    | Original  | Translated  | Word Type |
    |-----------|------------|-----------|
    | honey     | Schatz     | Noun      |
    | leave     | lassen     | Verb      |
    | key       | Schl√ºssel  | Noun      |
    | home      | Zuhause    | Noun      |
    | again     | wieder     | Adverb    |
    | mind      | st√∂ren     | Verb      |
    | pick up   | abholen    | Verb      |
    | way       | Weg        | Noun      |
    | back      | zur√ºck     | Adverb    |
    | work      | Arbeit     | Noun      |

    **Sentence structure:**  
    [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Location] [Time]  

    **Hints:**  
    - The subject is "I," so the verb must be conjugated accordingly.  
    - "Lassen" (leave) needs to be in the past tense.  
    - "Schl√ºssel" (keys) is plural, so ensure the correct article is used.  
    - "Zuhause" (home) does not need an article.  
    - "Abholen" (pick up) is a separable verb, meaning part of it moves to the end of the sentence.  
    - "Von der Arbeit" (from work) requires a preposition that changes the article of "Arbeit."  
    - "Wieder" (again) is an adverb and typically goes after the verb or at the end.  
    - The phrase "would you mind" is not directly translatable but can be expressed using "k√∂nnen" (can) or "st√∂ren" (to bother).  

    Try constructing the sentence step by step! üòä
